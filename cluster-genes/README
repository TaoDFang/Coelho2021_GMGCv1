# Dominant Set Based Gene Clustering

Clusters a large set of genes using a dominant set approach.

## Usage

0. Set values in `config.py`
1. Run `jug execute build-full-graph.py`. This will use a lot of resources and
the use of an HPC cluster is required for even medium-sized projects!
2. Run `jug execute postprocess-diamond.py
3. Run `generate-relationships.sh`

# TODO

[x] Better union-find. Currently, it is split into parsing and binary
generation as we can then use jug for parallelism, but it is not very robust
code.
[x] Merge postprocess & triplets

[ ] remove the header from nucleotide.redundant files
[ ] integrate generating & sorting of the triplets into a single function using local disk to avoid IO
[ ] remove `generate-relationships.sh` as a separate step
