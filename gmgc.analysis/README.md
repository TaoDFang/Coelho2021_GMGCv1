# Analyses of the GMGCv1

This directory contains the analyses presented in the manuscript (including the
code to generate the figures).

Note that it requires that you run the mappings in the `profiles-all` directory
to be directly usable, but the `preprocessed` directory in the root of the
repository contains preprocessed data which enable re-running the analyses
without running from scratch.
